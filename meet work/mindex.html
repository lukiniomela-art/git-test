        <h1>bear</h1>
        <p>In zoos, bears are a common attraction, with species like grizzlies, polar bears, and sun bears housed in enclosures. While some modern zoos design habitats to maximize animal welfare, housing bears in captivity is ethically complex and remains a subject of controversy. </p>

        <h1>wolf</h1>
        <p>Keeping wolves in a zoo environment involves careful consideration of their social, physical, and psychological needs. Exhibiting these highly social and wide-ranging animals raises complex issues about animal welfare, conservation, and the ethics of captivity. </p>

        <h1>lion</h1>
        <p>Lions in zoos, unlike their wild counterparts, have a significantly longer lifespan due to consistent veterinary care, protection from predators, and a steady supply of food. However, their daily life is dramatically different, including their diet, social structure, and activity levels.</p>
